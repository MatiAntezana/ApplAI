=== Main Content ===
Paragraph 1: AI Engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for solving complex problems through artificial intelligence. From founding a successful AI startup to developing novel neural network architectures, I turn innovative ideas into impactful solutions.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 2: I discovered programming at the age of 15 and quickly became fascinated with artificial intelligence. This passion led me to found Satellites On Fire, a startup that provided real-time wildfire alerts using satellite and camera imagery, which secured over $400,000 in investment and resulted in a successful exit.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 3: Currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Universidad de San Andrés (UdeSA) with a GPA of 9.17/10, I continue to explore the frontiers of AI through research and practical applications.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 4: My work includes developing novel neural network architectures, building self-balancing robots, and creating cloud-based AI solutions. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and contribute to the advancement of artificial intelligence.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 5: I develop novel AI architectures and solutions, including my published work on Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 6: Founded and led a successful AI startup that secured over $400,000 in investment with a focus on wildfire detection.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 7: Constantly expanding my knowledge in AI, robotics, and computer vision through academic and practical projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 8: Core languages for AI and software development
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 9: Advanced AI and ML technologies
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 10: Data processing and analysis
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 11: Cloud infrastructure and deployment
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 12: Robotics and embedded systems
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 13: Academic and applied research
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 14: With extensive experience in both AI research and practical applications, I bring a comprehensive understanding of artificial intelligence and software engineering to every project.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 15: Satellites On Fire was my startup that provided real-time wildfire alerts using satellite and camera imagery. As the founder and CIO, I led the development of AI models capable of detecting wildfires from various image sources. The system used a serverless AWS backend to process images, run detection algorithms, and send instant notifications to users. The startup secured over $400,000 in investment and is still active, but I made a successful exit. This project combined my passion for AI with a solution to a critical environmental problem.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 16: In this research project, I proposed a novel architecture for Convolutional Neural Networks based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks applied to Computer Vision. The key innovation was designing kernels as functions of the input pixels, enabling more learning at each convolution step. I published a paper on this work and released the open-source code, which has garnered more than 800 stars on GitHub and over 89 citations from other researchers. My work received significant recognition in the field, including being interviewed by IEEE Spectrum about the implications of this architecture. This project demonstrates my ability to contribute to the theoretical advancement of deep learning while providing practical implementations for the research community.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 17: During my internship at the Robotics and AI Lab at UdeSA, I built a self-balancing robot with two wheels and developed a mobile application to control it remotely. The robot featured a camera system that enabled it to detect, track, and follow objects of interest. This project combined principles of control systems, computer vision, and mobile app development. The robot demonstrated stable self-balancing capabilities while simultaneously processing visual information to track and follow targets, showcasing the integration of multiple technologies in a single robotic system.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 18: In this project titled '¿Sueñan los androides con Marios eléctricos?' (Do androids dream of electric Marios?), we adapted the DIAMOND architecture to create a neural network that replaces the Super Mario Bros game engine. The system consists of two main components: a Denoiser that predicts future game states in low resolution (64x60 pixels) and an Upsampler that increases the resolution to 256x240. We experimented with various data collection methods, including reinforcement learning agents and human gameplay, to train the model. The best results came from human gameplay data and balanced artificial datasets with game insights, which allowed the model to respond accurately to player inputs while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal coherence. This work demonstrates how diffusion models can be used to simulate complex game dynamics without traditional game engines.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 19: How Much VRAM is a web-based calculator that helps AI researchers and engineers estimate the GPU memory requirements for training and inferring with deep learning models. This tool addresses a common pain point in the machine learning workflow: determining if a model will fit on your GPU before starting a potentially time-consuming training process. The calculator supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks and allows users to input various parameters such as model architecture, batch size, input dimensions, and precision (FP32, FP16, or INT8). By providing accurate VRAM estimates, the tool helps users optimize their model configurations and avoid out-of-memory errors. The project has gained popularity in the AI community, achieving over 100 stars on GitHub, and serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 20: Trai is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that enables online shoppers to virtually try on clothing items before making a purchase. Using advanced deep learning models deployed on Google Cloud Functions with GPU acceleration, the platform can accurately render garments onto customer photos while maintaining lighting, pose, and fabric details. The serverless architecture ensures scalability and performance while keeping costs efficient. This project demonstrates my ability to build production-ready AI solutions that solve real business problems in the e-commerce space.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 21: Awarded by the Congressmen of Buenos Aires for outstanding contribution to scientific advancement through innovative AI applications (Satellites On Fire).
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 22: Maintaining a GPA of 9.17/10 in the Artificial Intelligence Engineering program at Universidad de San Andrés (UdeSA).
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 23: Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks repository has received over 800 stars on GitHub and 75+ citations in academic papers.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 24: Founded Satellites On Fire, which secured over $400,000 in investment and achieved a successful exit.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 25: Interviewed by IEEE Spectrum, a prestigious engineering magazine, about my research on Convolutional Kolmogorov Arnold Networks and its implications for the field of AI.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 26: A deep dive into the mathematics and intuition behind gradient descent, the fundamental optimization algorithm powering modern machine learning models.
--------------------------------------------------
Paragraph 27: A step-by-step tutorial on how to deploy machine learning models with GPU acceleration using Google Cloud's serverless architecture for cost-effective and scalable inference.
