As the founder and CIO, I led the development of AI models capable of detecting wildfires from various image sources. The system used a serverless AWS backend to process images, run detection algorithms, and send instant notifications to users. The startup secured over $400,000 in investment and is still active, but I made a successful exit. This project combined my passion for AI with a solution to a critical environmental problem.Key Features:Cloud-based models for real-time wildfire detectionSatellite and camera image processingAWS serverless backend for instant notificationsHistorical data access and analysisImage collection and labeling pipelineDeep LearningStartupLive DemoConvolutional Kolmogorov Arnold NetworksDeep LearningComputer VisionResearchLoading video...In this research project, I proposed a novel architecture for Convolutional Neural Networks based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks applied to Computer Vision. The key innovation was designing kernels as functions of the input pixels, enabling more learning at each convolution step. I published a paper on this work and released the open-source code, which has garnered more than 800 stars on GitHub and over 89 citations from other researchers. My work received significant recognition in the field, including being interviewed by IEEE Spectrum about the implications of this architecture. This project demonstrates my ability to contribute to the theoretical advancement of deep learning while providing practical implementations for the research community.Key Features:Novel CNN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold NetworksKernels as functions of input pixelsEnhanced learning capability per convolutionOpen source implementation with 850+ GitHub stars89+ academic citationsPyTorchOpen SourceCodeWatch DemoRead PaperIEEE InterviewBalancio: Self-Balancing RobotRoboticsComputer VisionMobile AppLoading video...During my internship at the Robotics and AI Lab at UdeSA, I built a self-balancing robot with two wheels and developed a mobile application to control it remotely. The robot featured a camera system that enabled it to detect, track, and follow objects of interest. This project combined principles of control systems, computer vision, and mobile app development. The robot demonstrated stable self-balancing capabilities while simultaneously processing visual information to track and follow targets, showcasing the integration of multiple technologies in a single robotic system.Key Features:Two-wheeled self-balancing mechanismMobile app for remote controlCamera integration for visual perceptionObject tracking and following capabilitiesReal-time control systemControl SystemsCodeWatch DemoSuper Mario DIAMONDDiffusion ModelsNeural Game EngineComputer VisionIn this project titled '¿Sueñan los androides con Marios eléctricos?' (Do androids dream of electric Marios?), we adapted the DIAMOND architecture to create a neural network that replaces the Super Mario Bros game engine. The system consists of two main components: a Denoiser that predicts future game states in low resolution (64x60 pixels) and an Upsampler that increases the resolution to 256x240. We experimented with various data collection methods, including reinforcement learning agents and human gameplay, to train the model. The best results came from human gameplay data and balanced artificial datasets with game insights, which allowed the model to respond accurately to player inputs while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal coherence. This work demonstrates how diffusion models can be used to simulate complex game dynamics without traditional game engines.Key Features:Adaptation of DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams) to Super Mario BrosDual architecture with Denoiser (4M parameters) and Upsampler (50M parameters)Low-resolution game dynamics (64x60) upscaled to high-resolution (256x240)Multiple data collection strategies including human gameplay and RL agent dataInteractive neural game engine responding to player inputsPyTorchDeep LearningCodeLive DemoHow Much VRAMPyTorchTensorFlowWeb AppHow Much VRAM is a web-based calculator that helps AI researchers and engineers estimate the GPU memory requirements for training and inferring with deep learning models. This tool addresses a common pain point in the machine learning workflow: determining if a model will fit on your GPU before starting a potentially time-consuming training process. The calculator supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks and allows users to input various parameters such as model architecture, batch size, input dimensions, and precision (FP32, FP16, or INT8). By providing accurate VRAM estimates, the tool helps users optimize their model configurations and avoid out-of-memory errors. The project has gained popularity in the AI community, achieving over 100 stars on GitHub, and serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.Key Features:Accurate VRAM estimation for training and inference of neural networksSupport for PyTorch and TensorFlow modelsInteractive web interface with real-time calculationsCustomizable parameters for model architecture, batch size, and precisionOpen-source project with 100+ GitHub starsDeep LearningDeveloper ToolCodeLive DemoTrai: Virtual Try-On SaaSAIGoogle CloudGPUTrai is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that enables online shoppers to virtually try on clothing items before making a purchase.
